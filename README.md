Linear Regression from Scratch to describe how the algorithm works under the hood

# **Linear Regression From Scratch**
    1. Change the number of observations to 100,000 and see what happens.
    2. Change the number of observations to 1,000,000 and see what happens.
    3. Play around with the learning rate. Values like 0.0001, 0.001, 0.1, 1 are all interesting to observe. 
    4. Change the loss function. L2-norm loss (without dividing by 2) is a good way to start. 
    5. Тry with the L1-norm loss, given by the sum of the ABSOLUTE value of yj - tj. The L1-norm loss is given by:
##                                             Σi=|yi−ti|
    6. Create a function f(x0,x1,x2) = 8*x0 + 2*x1 - 4*x2 + 5. Does the algorithm work in the same way?
